Earth Enterprise is the open source release of Google Earth Enterprise, a geospatial application which provides the ability to build and host custom 3D globes and 2D maps. Earth Enterprise does not provide a private version of Google imagery thatâ€™s currently available in Google Maps or Earth.

The application suite consists of four core components:

Fusion - Imports and processes imagery, vector and terrain source data

Server - Apache or Tornado-based server which hosts the private globes built by Fusion

Portable - A disconnected globe that allows you to access your data in a local-server configuration

Client - The Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) and Google Maps Javascript API V3 used to view 3D globes and 2D maps, respectively.
