We’d love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

### Contributing to Earth Enterprise

Earth Enterprise welcomes community contributions! If you’re interested in making a contribution to this project, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/google/earthenterprise/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start writing any code:

1. Sign the contributor's agreement. This will allow us to review and accept contributions.
2. Reach out to us to discuss your contribution. Either update an existing issue, or create a new one that describes the change you would like to work on. If in doubt, feel free to just create a new issue.
3. Begin a discussion on the issue describing the intended changes. Earth Enterprise developers can help hash out the approach and make sure everyone is on the same page before too much time is spent writing the code changes and associated tests.
4. Make the code changes and open a pull request.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution, this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. Head over to https://cla.developers.google.com/ to see your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you’ve already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don’t need to do it again.
Code reviews
