# A collection of preprocessed Google Earth Enterprise Assets 

The purpose of this page is to share the availability of preprocessed Google Earth Enterprise Assets (.kip / .kmp, etc.) 

These assets should assist GEE Open Source users in quickly sourcing basemap data and building globes without having to seek out commonly used source datasets and spend time processing them. 

If you have a preprocessed dataset you think the community would appreciate, please open an issue to have it included.
