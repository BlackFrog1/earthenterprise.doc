# Earth Enterprise

Earth Enterprise is the open source release of Google Earth Enterprise, a geospatial application which provides the ability to build and host custom 3D globes and 2D maps. Earth Enterprise does not provide a private version of Google imagery that’s currently available in Google Maps or Earth.

The application suite consists of four core components:

Fusion - Builds 3D Earth and 2D Map from imagery, vector and terrain source data.

Server - Apache -based server which hosts 3D Earth, 2D Map build by Fusion and Portable 3D/2D globes.

Portable - Tornado-based server which hosts Portable 3D/2D globes in a local-server configuration.

Client - The Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) and Google Maps Javascript API V3 used to view 3D globes and 2D maps, respectively.

For more information please take a look at the 'Overview' and 'Fusion Tutorial' articles in our docs.

Earth Enterprise welcomes community contributions! If you’re interested in making a contribution to this project, please follow the [guidelines](https://github.com/google/earthenterprise/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you start writing any code:

1. Sign the contributor's agreement. This will allow us to review and accept contributions.
